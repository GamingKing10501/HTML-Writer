# HTML-Writer
it is a application i am writing that is used to create simple webpages. It is used to write webpages quickly and avoid writing all the code yourself. 
This is currenty on the beta stage and after creating a webpage you must open the file and replace some text and then click save as and type new name and .html.
open find and replace feature in notepad replace "(double inverted commas) with space(make sure to have wrap text on),then replace ,(comma) with space(turn on wrap text if off)
,then replace ( (opening brackets) with " (double inverted comma). After that, save the file as html(do not change the original txt file, make a duplicate file). 
make sure that the application and the new.txt file are in the same folder.
enjoy!!
next update coming soon.
